# Daily-SQL-Challenge

Daily SQL Challenge by SQL Prep. This was one of those sites that regularly broadcasted SQL quizzes on a daily basis. Unfortunately the site is no longer available. The Schema and the output of the quiz was meant for SQL Server. With some tweaks I was able to get a working schema executed on Oracle and attempted at the SQL quizzes on a daily basis for 100 days.
The tweaks that I employed were: a) removing the Primary Key completely (not a smart decision but decided to do it as the focus was to practice and attempt these challenges) b) commenting the decimals as Oracle would throw the following error: /**SQLDEV:FAILED TO TRANSLATE AS Decimal(10, 2))) **/
