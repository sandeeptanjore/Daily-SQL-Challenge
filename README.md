# Daily-SQL-Challenge

Hello,
Many thanks for taking your precious time to go through my Daily SQL Challenge by SQL Prep scripts.

Daily SQL Challenge by SQL Prep, was one of those sites that regularly broadcasted SQL quizzes on a daily basis. Unfortunately the site is no longer present on the internet. My attempts to connect(email, Facebook and LinkedIn messages) with the owner of the site did not yield any results. 
The Schema and the output of the quiz was meant for SQL Server. With some tweaks I was able to get a working schema executed on Oracle and attempted at the SQL quizzes on a daily basis for 100 days.

The tweaks that I employed were: a) removing the Primary Key completely (not a smart decision but decided to do it as the focus was to practice and attempt these challenges) b) commenting the decimals as Oracle would throw the following error: /**SQLDEV:FAILED TO TRANSLATE AS Decimal(10, 2))) **/

The original site was hosted at: https://www.sqlprep.com/blog
